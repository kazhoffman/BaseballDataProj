With this project, I was to project the “true” average speed-off-bat (on the scale of system A, or system B, or 
some combination of the two systems) for each batter in the following season. Attached is my code for the program, The initial instructions, and my write up. This was a project I took upon myself in school, and would love for feedback and ways to improve!
